                The Monty Hall problem, named after the host of the American television game show "Let's Make a
                Deal,"
                has captivated mathematicians, statisticians, and enthusiasts since it emerged. Despite its apparent
                simplicity, this probability puzzle defies intuition and challenges our understanding of chances.

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center pt-4">So, in short, Mr. Whitaker wanted to know: does it make a difference if
                        you switch doors on "Let's Make a Deal"?</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-4">
                    <p class="text-center">Marilyn Von Savant had a somewhat surprising answer to this question:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center">Her answer is that you double your winning chances if you switch to the other
                        unopened door when the host makes the offer.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Although it is an explanation, it still doesn't quite make sense to most of
                        us.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">With 1 car and 1 goat and 2 doors, it seems to be a 50/50 case, and the fact
                        that the host eliminated a goat door shouldn't really affect the odds.</p>

            <h3 class="pb-4">As it turned out, the response to the reader's question in Parade was completely
                correct—you should definitely switch doors if given the option.</h3>
            <p>This bit of statistics is as counterintuitive as they get. The fact remains, however, that the initially
                chosen door has a 1/3 chance of winning, while the second one has a 2/3 chance, although most of us
                would say it was the same odds for both doors.</p>
            <p>Another very odd thing about this problem is that if the host chose at random and happened to choose a
                goat door, it would indeed be 50/50. Very strange.</p>
            <p>At least the solution can be calculated using something called "Bayes' theorem".</p>
