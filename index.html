    <h1 class="header-title">THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM</h1>
    <h2 class="header-subtitle">The Monty Hall problem, named after the host of the American television game show "Let's
        Make a Deal,"
        has captivated mathematicians, statisticians, and enthusiasts since it emerged.
        Despite its apparent simplicity, this probability puzzle defies intuition and challenges our understanding of
        chances.

                    <h4>In 1990, a reader submitted the following question to the
                        magazine "Parade" asking their inhouse genius,
                        Marilyn Von Savant:</h4>

                    <p>Marilyn Von Savant had a somewhat surprising answer to this question: </p>
                    <img class="toggle-class" src="answer.png" style="max-height:300px;" />
                    <p>So switch and double your chances? With 1 car and 1 goat left surely
                        it doesn't matter if you switch doors? Logic tells us that each door had a 1/3 chance of holding
                        the
                        car when the game started. After the host eliminated a goat door, the odds must be 1/2 for each
                        remaining door. Either your chosen door has the car or the other door has it, a 50/50 case.
                        Right?

                    It doesn't seem to make sense.

                <h3>As it turned out, the response to the readers question in Parade was completely correct-
                    you should definitely switch doors if given the option.
                </h3>
                <p>This bit of statistics is a counter intuitive as they get.
                    The fact remains, however, that the chosen door intially had a 1/3 chance of having a car behind it
                    and those odds
                    stay the same throughout the game. The solution can even be calculated using something called
                    "Bayes' theorem".
                    <br><br>
                <p>Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of
                    conditions related to the event. The formula is:</p>

                    </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>P(A|B)</strong> is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has
