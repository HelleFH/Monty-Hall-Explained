    <h2 class="header-subtitle">The Monty Hall problem, named after the host of the American television game show "Let's
        Make a Deal,"
        has captivated mathematicians, statisticians, and enthusiasts since it emerged.
        Despite its apparent simplicity, this probability puzzle defies intuition and challenges our understanding of
        chances.

                    <h4>In 1990, a reader submitted the following question to the
                        magazine "Parade" asking their inhouse genius,
                        Marilyn Von Savant:</h4>

                    </div>
                    <p>So, in short, Mr. Whitaker wanted to know- does it make a difference if you switch doors on
                        "Let's Make a Deal"?
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                </div>

                <div>

                    <p>Marilyn Von Savant had a somewhat surprising answer to this question: </p>
                    <img class="toggle-class" src="answer.png" style="max-height:300px;" />
                    <p>
                        Her answer is that you double your winning chances if you switch to the other unopened door
                        when the hosts makes the offer.

                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    If you chose a door out of a million where 999.999 had goats and only one had a car, your odds would
                    obviously not be good.
                    However, if the host opened all the doors, but one, and gave you a choice between that and your
                    chosen one, you'd probably switch.
                    It was one out 999.999, after all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although it is an explaination, it still doesn't quite make sense to most of use.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With 1 car and 1 goat and 2 doors, it seems to be a 50/50 case, and the fact that the host
                        eliminated a goat door shouldn't really affect the odds.

                    </p>

                <p>It does matter that the host removed a losing door, however, according to Mary Von Savant. Using her
                    perplexing example, she claimed that, counter
                    to what we all assume, switching doors is a very good strategy.
                    It doesn't seem to make sense.

            <div class="section-content-text">
                <h3>As it turned out, the response to the readers question in Parade was completely correct-
                    you should definitely switch doors if given the option.
                </h3>
                <p>This bit of statistics is a counter intuitive as they get.
                    The fact remains, however, that the initially chosen door has a 1/3 chance of winning, the second one has a 2/3 chance, although most of us would say it was the same odds for both doors. 
                    Another very odd thing about this problem is that if the host chose at random and happened to chose a goat door, it would indeed be 50/50. Very strange.
                    
                    <p>At least the solution can be calculated using something called "Bayes' theorem".</p>
               
                <p>Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of
                    conditions related to the event. The formula is:</p>

                <div class="math-section">
                    <div class="math">
                        <br>

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>P(A|B)</strong> is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has
                            occurred.</li>
                        <li><strong>P(B|A)</strong> is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has
                            occurred.</li>
                        <li><strong>P(A)</strong> is the prior probability of event A.</li>
                        <li><strong>P(B)</strong> is the prior probability of event B.</li>
