            <h3 class="pb-4">As it turned out, the response to the reader's question in Parade was completely correct—you should definitely switch doors if given the option.</h3>
            <p>This bit of statistics is as counterintuitive as they get. The fact remains, however, that the initially chosen door has a 1/3 chance of winning, while the second one has a 2/3 chance, although most of us would say it was the same odds for both doors.</p>
            <p>Another very odd thing about this problem is that if the host chose at random and happened to choose a goat door, it would indeed be 50/50. Very strange.</p>
            <p>At least the solution can be calculated using something called "Bayes' theorem".</p>
